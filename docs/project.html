        <div class="articletitle"> Why is racism so rampant? </div>

        <div class="articlediv">
            <p> Many people have many different answers to that question. Some say racism isn't that big of a problem
            however, many people have lost their lives due to racism. It is one of the worst sentiments that humaity has ever followed.
            Millions of people were enslaved, tortured, and murdered, not too long ago. </p>

            <br>

            <p> When people were asked the question there were many answers, some simply did not know, others had a good idea on why.
            Some think that other races are jelous, but in my opinion the best answer was that, it's easier to target others when they have a different
            nationality or skin color because they're different from you. </p>

            <br>

            <p> Others believe that society has improved greatly from the past. When I asked people how, they replied with very different answers.
            Some believed that the existence of the problem itself meant that we haven't improved at all. Others thought that racism isn't as rampant because educating
            people that it was bad and impolite to treat people based on their race is working. Stopping slavery was also mentioned when the question was askedwhy it isn't as rampant.
            Some said that famous celebrity role models stood up against racism and taught people worldwide about human rights and issues with racism. </p>

            <br>

            <p> When asked how we could continue and eventually stop racism, they said we needed to continue to educate everybody about the problem, and
            to not be biased towards anyone based on their race and stand up against racists. </p>
